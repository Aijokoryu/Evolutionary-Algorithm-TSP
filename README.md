This is my first public repository, i am a cs student and this is a small evolutionary algorithm for TSP.
The programm starts in the "programm.cs" file and most of the code are in the "TSP" and "Population" file. 
If you want to use different TSP data you can download some sample data like i did from :http://comopt.ifi.uni-heidelberg.de/software/TSPLIB95/tsp/ to download them and drop them in the XMLData folder!
Feel free for to leave some feedback (if thats is possible on Github) I am happy to learn from you ~
